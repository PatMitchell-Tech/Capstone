My capstone project is based around malware research and development.

In my project I have created many different types of malware such as: Keyloggers, winlockers, SSH brute forcer, and a Program for Phishing/email spamming.

Not all of the code used in these programs are originally written by me and I will give credit to the original malware developer(s) in those respective programs.

This page will be updated closer to the end of my current capstone project

Radius.py dependencies: pynput module                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                     
To perform this on windows type pip install pynput into cmd or powershell. If you are on linux type into your terminal: sudo apt install python3-pynput              

sshbruter.py dependencies: You will need a .csv file 

You need to match the .csv file to the list file in the sshbruter.py program. You will also need to put a list of usernames in the first section and then passwords 
in the second. Example:
