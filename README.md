My capstone project is based around malware research and development.

In my project I have created many different types of malware such as: Keyloggers, winlockers, SSH brute forcer, and a Program for Phishing/email spamming.

Not all of the code used in these programs are originally written by me and I will give credit to the original malware developer(s) in those respective programs.
